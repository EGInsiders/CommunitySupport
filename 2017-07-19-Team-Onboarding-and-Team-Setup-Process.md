# Team Onboarding and Team Setup Process

After an organization purchases their team, an EduGuide Staff member will create the team and then send an invitation to a contact with the organization asking them to create an account and begin the process of setting up their team.

As the initial team admin coach completes the set up process begun by EduGuide, they will be asked to appoint a team administrator, set the auto groups feature, invite a team captain, invite coaches, and schedule training.

## Appointing someone else to administer the team

With the team, there tends to be a designated member of an organization who logs into the team first, responds to questions and sends invitations to their colleagues who they would like to serve as coaches on the team. EduGuide will send a request to the person it has been working with at that organization, but we recognize that sometimes it might be preferable to ask somebody else to handle the details of getting the team ready to launch. After you register for the site and join the team, you will be asked if you would like to administer the team, or if you would like to appoint someone else. If you choose to appoint somebody else, you will be prompted for their email address and a custom message. They will receive your invitation and have the opportunity to join the site and continue the process where you left off.

You will still be an admin coach on the team, so if there are other coaches who have questions about the site they will easily be able to contact.

## Team Setup Page

You will be able to complete all of the steps for team configuration from your team's Setup page. The first time that you log into your account, you will be taken into the team’s setup, but in the future when you log in you can navigate to this page by clicking on "Setup" in the main navigation menu.

The setup page is broken up into sections which focus on different aspects of the team's setup process. As you work your way down the page, you will send a request for IT testing, adjust the auto grouping settings, send an invitation to someone who you would like to serve as a team captain, and send invitations to the team’s coaches.

As you complete each step in the process, a green checkmark will appear next to the section titles. You can skip a step, then return later to enter in the missing information. Subsequent admin coaches who join your team will also be able to complete the configuration settings for the team.

### IT Testing

IT Testing is the process through which technicians at an organization run through a brief sequence of screens which help to ensure that students will have a smooth experience as when they begin using the path system on EduGuide. They will be asked to verify that they've allowed access to EduGuide.org, and prompted to complete a test path which screens for any potential problems.

After you send the request, an orange checkmark will appear next to the "IT Testing" header. When the testing is complete, the checkmark will turn green.

### Sending Invitations

The next two screens are devoted to the process of sending invitations to the members of your staff who you would like to serve as team coaches. For more details on the responsibilities of the different coach roles [Click here].

For both the Team Captain and the team coaches, you will be entering email addresses and then sending invitations. Inside the Send invitation screens that appear, you will be prompted for  custom messages and a student start date. These are both optional, but help to customize your message. After you click "send invite," the invitations will be sent to your colleagues asking them to join your team.
