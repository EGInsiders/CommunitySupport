# Test the Freshdesk Live Chat Feature

## Description

We have recently implemented a new live chat feature on the staging site. The behavior of the tab is that it won't appear until you click on "Chat with us" in the link within the main menu on the site. When you end the chat, the tab will then disappear. This is very similar to the current live chat feature that we have implemented on the live site.I'm asking everybody to test out the live chat by sending chat messages. You can ask any questions, either a real technical one, or a movie quote, or just a "Hello" and a quick back and forth.The only difference in scenarios is that the users might use the site on different platforms or browsers, so it is important to test the chat under different conditions. These include on a computer, smartphone, tablet, and on browsers like Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.One known issue is that the chat window hasn't been responsive in Safari and Internet Explorer. But, log this as an issue if you see it happen there or under any other circumstance.The link will only appear when I'm logged into Freshdesk, so you will need to test during business hours. If you want to test after 5 p.m. let me know and I can log in temporarily.Discuss problems inside this record, and log issues or feature changes under the appropriate app inside the workspace. I am available via chat inside Podio or email [jon@eduguide.org](mailto:jon@eduguide.org).
